 # The whole architecture design contains three contents:

*   First is a serviceAPI design, build a corresponding custom server;
 
*  The second is the design of agent, that is, the specific requirements of the design ideas, code design;

*   Finally, we consider how to connect agent, server and Kubernetes, and how to deploy agent to Kubernetes.
